# SUSHI-lib

## About

This repository contains the runtime library part of [SUSHI](https://github.com/pietrobraione/sushi) and [TARDIS](https://github.com/pietrobraione/sushi). Here you will find classes for managing the configuration parameters of SUSHI, for making SUSHI and TARDIS interact with EvoSuite, and for calculating branch coverage. There is no real use of the SUSHI-lib project apart from being a submodule of SUSHI and TARDIS, so refer to them for setup instructions.
